# rustybrain
A lightweight, **test-driven AI/ML infrastructure toolkit** written in Rust.

The goal of `rustybrain` is to build reusable AI systems primitives — like 
reward normalization, multi-armed bandits, and adaptive control utilities —
that form the backbone of modern AIOps and online learning systems.
